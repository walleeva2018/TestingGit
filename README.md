## Starting Git 
<ol>
<li>To start using git you may first download it in your system from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"> Here </a> . Its straight forward so it won't be a problem.</li> 
<li>Okay Now that you have git installed . As you are seeing this in github I am hoping you already have a Github account. If not please create a github account</li>
<li> Now that you have git and github. To communicate between your local system and remote repo there are 3 main ways 
  <ul>
     <li> HTTPS </li>
      <li> SSH  </li>
       <li> Github CLI </li>
   </ul>
    SSH is mostly used and suggested to communicate between your local and remote repo 
    You can setup your SSH keys for <a href="https://github.com/sysdevbd/sysdevbd.github.io/tree/master/git">Ubuntu </a> and <a href="https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/GitHub-SSH-Windows-Example">windows</a>

    If its too overwhelming for you can just use HTTPS as well thats easy but less secure and require auth every time.So suggestion is start with HTTPS then move to SSH as you learn.

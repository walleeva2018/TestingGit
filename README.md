## Plase follow the following steps to get your work starting 

<ol>

## Starting Git 
<ol>
<li>To start using git you may first download it in your system from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"> Here </a> . Its straight forward so it won't be a problem.</li> 
<li>Okay Now that you have git installed . As you are seeing this in github I am hoping you already have a Github account. If not please create a github account</li>
<li> Now that you have git and github. To communicate between your local system and remote repo there are 3 main ways 
  <ul>
     <li> HTTPS </li>
      <li> SSH  </li>
       <li> Github CLI </li>
   </ul>
    SSH is mostly used and suggested to communicate between your local and remote repo 
    You can setup your SSH keys for <a href="https://github.com/sysdevbd/sysdevbd.github.io/tree/master/git">Ubuntu </a> and <a href="https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/GitHub-SSH-Windows-Example">windows</a>
If its too overwhelming for you can just use HTTPS as well thats easy but less secure and require auth every time.So suggestion is start with HTTPS then move to SSH as you learn.
</li> 
</ol>

## Startng Actual Work 

### Now you are set to go.
### There are many ways you can start practicing.
### First clone the project in your local PC. Open a folder then open terminal then clone the project by writting ```git clone SSH/HTTPS ``` you can find the SSH or HTTPS link from second navbar with green button. Copy the link replace SSH/HTTPS with that link 

### You will see many many files. 

## Follow this 
#### First you should only focus one Homepage.html file And do the following to to start real work 
##### Click on the Homepage.html to open it in browser 
##### See how people have created their own pages click on them to look around 
##### Now first you can make any changes  by opening Homepage.html with any text editor  without removing any name. Codes are commented for you to understand 
##### you should write your name in it 
##### Later you will link your profile with your name just like all other
##### After adding your name save the file
##### Now go to terminal write ``` git add Homepage.html ```  This you stage ( getting ready to commit)  your file
##### Now type ``` git commit -m "First Commit by your_name" ``` This will commit the file locally 
##### Now type ```git push``` This will commit the changes to Homepage.html remotely .
<B> N.B This is not best practice for git but we will get to that soon. Also if you are using HTTPS after you push it may ask you to authenticate </B>
